    <!-- 
        Paragraphs are an example of block elements becase by default they take 
        up the entire width of the web page and add space at the top and bottom 
        of the element.

        We showed the difference between block and inline elements using Developer
        Tools, which we accessed using CTRL+SHIFT+I. Developer tools is helpful to
        show you the exact code that is used to display a specific element and can
        show you the width, height, and spacing around an element.

    <!--
        Anchors are an example of inline elements because by default, they only
        take up the space that they need to.

        This is an example of an image tag.
        The scr attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
        The src attribute can be an Internet location.
        The best practice is to have your own image folder with all the images
        used on your website.

        NOTE: img is a self closing tag
