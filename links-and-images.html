        This is an example of an image tag.
        The scr attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
        The src attribute can be an Internet location.
        The best practice is to have your own image folder with all the images
        used on your website.

        NOTE: img is a self closing tag
    -->    
    <img 
        src="images/DannyDevito.jfif"
        width="50%" 
        height="50%"
        alt="Front on view of Frank Reynolds (Danny Devito) wearing a toga on the 
        set of It's Always Sunny In Philidelphia"
