<body>
    <!--
        Each element that we create for a website NEEDS to go in the body of the document.

        Most elements start with an opening tag and end with a closing tag.
        In this example, "<p>" is the opening tag and "</p>" is the closing tag.
        Inside the opening and closing tags is the content you actually want to display 
        on the website, in this example it's "Hello, World".

        <p>Hello World<p>
        This is an example of a paragraph tag
    -->
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <h2>Welcom to My First Web Project</h2>
    <h3>Please be Gentle...</h3>

    <!--
        Insert links with the "<a>" tag which otherwise known as the achor tag. The href defines 
        the link address and target="_blank" makes it so the tab is opened in a new window.

        The content between the tags is the text you click on for the link
